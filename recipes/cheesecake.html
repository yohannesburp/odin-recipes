    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This spongy, light cheesecake is good plain, with fresh fruit topping, or you can even frost it.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cubed</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>10 tablespoons cake flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch </li>
        <li>6 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice </li>
        <li>6 egg whites </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>10 tablespoons superfine sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8-inch round cake pan and line with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Place cream cheese in a bowl with milk; soak for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat cream cheese with milk and butter in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently, until melted and smooth, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cool completely, at least 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sift cake flour and cornstarch together into a bowl. Sift again into the cream cheese mixture; mix well. Add egg yolks and lemon juice and mix well.</li>
        <li>Beat egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt together in a separate bowl using an electric mixer until foamy; add sugar, 2 tablespoons at a time, beating well after each addition. Continue beating on high speed until soft peaks form.</li>
        <li>Fold cream cheese mixture into egg white mixture until well mixed; pour into the prepared pan. Place pan inside a larger baking dish and fill the baking dish with water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the cake pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheesecake is set and golden brown on top, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Turn off oven and leave cake in oven with door ajar for 1 hour. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
